#  About this exercise from the Apple sample code

If you are trying to follow up the [tutorials from the Apple site](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/composing-complex-interfaces) you may have noticed already that I am creating them from scratch... The reason is the code doesn't compile or it has a few features that have changed since it was announced and Apple hasn't updated.

This code was done following beta 5.
